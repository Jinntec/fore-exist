## Purpose of this repo

The purpose of this project is two-fold:

1. modernizing our old clinton to make it more effective also in terms of being used ;)
2. providing a playground for latest technologies we have developed like Roaster and Fore but beyond that also exploring best practices of app development.

### Ideas for modernizing clinton

Clinton is critical infrastructure for our work as it is the foundation for all
or our cash flows either invoicing customers but also for freelancers and external
partners.

The current version is very much outdated and still relies on betterFORM for the frontend.
Furthermore it falls short in some UX respects which obviously makes it an unloved
tool and constant pressure is needed to get the numbers we need to drive our business.

By improving the UX and offering additional value for the users i hope we can improve
this situation.

Secondly it's hard to explore the tools and technologies we develop over time once
you are in a project context and under time- and budget pressure. So often
solutions fall short of what could potentially achieved as there's a lack of time
to think it to the end.

As such this project can either serve the role of showcasing the new tools as
well as test them in a context where no direct harm is done to commercial projects.

### Technologies 

This is a simple (but hopefully growing) list of technologies that can be involved:

* Roaster - first and foremost Roaster is a complete new way of building an interface
for eXist-db applications. It's a powerful replacement to the old controller.xql approach
* Web Components - we have gathered some experience here especially in TEI Publisher context. This project
offers to 'play' with alternative approaches and helping libraries
* Fore - as a replacement to betterFORM on the forms front it can show how to solve certain problems.
* Routing and PWAs - we have no concrete experience in these areas so its an opportunity to engage them in a real project.
